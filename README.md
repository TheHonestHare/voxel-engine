My attempt at creating a voxel renderer using zig, WGSL, and the Mach framework.

## Building:
You will need zig version 0.13.0-dev.351+64ef45eb0 (this is the version mach uses)
To build, run `zig build`
TODO: Fix `zig build run` and `-Dno_dev` in the build script

## Contributing:
Right now this is just a hobby project for me. In the future, if this ever takes off the ground, I'll accept contributions. But as of now, no contributions will be accepted.
